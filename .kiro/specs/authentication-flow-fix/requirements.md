# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The PathNiti application is experiencing critical authentication flow issues after successful login. Users can log in successfully, but when redirected to the complete profile section, they encounter multiple errors including duplicate profile creation attempts, webpack module loading failures, and hydration errors. These issues prevent users from completing their registration flow and accessing the application properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to complete my profile after login without encountering duplicate key errors, so that I can successfully register and access the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL check if a profile already exists before attempting to create one
2. WHEN a profile already exists for a user THEN the system SHALL skip profile creation and proceed to the appropriate dashboard
3. WHEN profile creation fails due to duplicate key constraint THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and fetch the existing profile
4. WHEN a user accesses the complete profile page with an existing profile THEN they SHALL be redirected to their appropriate dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load without webpack module errors and hydration issues, so that I can use the application without encountering JavaScript runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN there SHALL be no webpack module loading errors related to "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')"
2. WHEN React components hydrate THEN there SHALL be no hydration mismatches between server and client
3. WHEN dynamic imports are used THEN they SHALL load properly without undefined module references
4. WHEN the application renders THEN all required modules SHALL be available and properly initialized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and proper error handling when authentication issues occur, so that I understand what went wrong and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message instead of technical error details
2. WHEN profile creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on next steps
3. WHEN the "E.C.P is not enabled" error occurs THEN the system SHALL either enable the feature or provide an alternative flow
4. WHEN webpack errors occur THEN they SHALL be caught and handled gracefully without breaking the user experience

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a smooth post-login experience that automatically determines where I should go based on my profile status, so that I don't get stuck in redirect loops or incomplete flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL determine their profile completion status and redirect appropriately
2. WHEN a user has a complete profile THEN they SHALL be redirected to their role-appropriate dashboard
3. WHEN a user has an incomplete profile THEN they SHALL be redirected to complete their profile
4. WHEN a user is in the complete profile flow THEN the system SHALL prevent duplicate profile creation attempts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want robust error boundaries and fallback mechanisms for authentication flows, so that users don't encounter unrecoverable application states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication components encounter errors THEN error boundaries SHALL catch them and display fallback UI
2. WHEN profile operations fail THEN the system SHALL have retry mechanisms or alternative flows
3. WHEN webpack module loading fails THEN the system SHALL have fallback loading strategies
4. WHEN hydration errors occur THEN the system SHALL recover gracefully and continue functioning
