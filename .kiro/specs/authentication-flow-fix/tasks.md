# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix profile creation duplicate key error in AuthProvider
  - Add profile existence check before creation attempts

  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3_

- [x] 2. Implement profile state deduplication in AuthProvider
  - Add state tracking to prevent multiple simultaneous profile operations for the same user
  - Implement debouncing for profile creation calls in auth state change handler
  - Add profile operation locks to prevent race conditions
  - Cache profile creation results to avoid redundant database calls
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.4_

- [ ] 3. Fix webpack module loading errors and dynamic imports
  - Identify and fix undefined module references causing "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" errors
  - Add proper error boundaries around dynamic imports and lazy-loaded components
  - Implement fallback loading strategies for failed module imports
  - Add module availability checks before attempting to use imported modules
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3, 5.3_

- [ ] 4. Resolve React hydration errors and server-client mismatches
  - Identify components causing hydration mismatches between server and client rendering
  - Implement proper client-only rendering for components that depend on browser APIs
  - Add suppressHydrationWarning where appropriate for known client-server differences
  - Fix useEffect dependencies and initial state management to prevent hydration issues
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 5.4_

- [ ] 5. Enhance complete profile page with better error handling
  - Add profile existence check on page load to redirect users with existing profiles
  - Implement proper error handling for profile creation failures
  - Add user-friendly error messages for common profile creation issues
  - Implement retry mechanisms for transient profile creation failures
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Fix "E.C.P is not enabled" error and related configuration issues
  - Identify the source of the "E.C.P is not enabled" error message
  - Check and fix any missing feature flags or configuration settings
  - Implement proper error handling for configuration-related errors
  - Add fallback flows when certain features are not enabled
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 7. Implement comprehensive error boundaries for authentication flows
  - Create specialized error boundaries for authentication-related components
  - Add error classification to distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable errors
  - Implement retry mechanisms and fallback UI for authentication errors
  - Add error reporting and logging for monitoring authentication issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.1, 5.2_

- [ ] 8. Optimize authentication state management and reduce redundant operations
  - Implement proper caching for profile data to reduce database queries
  - Add state deduplication to prevent unnecessary re-renders and API calls
  - Optimize auth state change handlers to prevent cascading effects
  - Add performance monitoring for authentication operations
  - _Requirements: 4.4, 5.2_

- [ ] 9. Add robust post-login redirect logic based on profile status
  - Implement smart redirect logic that checks profile completion status
  - Add role-based redirect logic for different user types
  - Prevent redirect loops by tracking redirect history
  - Add loading states during profile status determination
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 10. Create comprehensive error recovery mechanisms
  - Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed operations
  - Add manual retry options for users when automatic retry fails
  - Create fallback UI components for various error states
  - Add error state persistence to maintain context across page reloads
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [ ] 11. Add authentication flow monitoring and logging
  - Implement detailed logging for profile creation attempts and failures
  - Add performance metrics tracking for authentication operations
  - Create error monitoring dashboard for authentication issues
  - Add user journey tracking to identify common failure points
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 5.1_

- [ ] 12. Test and validate complete authentication flow
  - Test profile creation with existing and new users
  - Validate error handling for all identified error scenarios
  - Test webpack module loading and hydration fixes
  - Verify smooth user experience from login to dashboard access
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1_
