  - Simplify loading states using central auth loading
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1_

- [x] 4. Refactor Quiz page to use central authentication
  - Remove redundant authentication checks and user fetching
  - Replace with useAuth hook for user and session data
  - Implement requireAuth() for quiz access enforcement
  - Remove duplicate loading logic and use central auth loading
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 4.1_

- [x] 5. Enhance middleware for server-side route protection
  - Implement proper session validation in middleware
  - Add role-based access control for admin and college routes

  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Create authentication utilities and helpers
  - Create reusable authentication guard components
  - Implement withAuth higher-order component for page protection
  - Add authentication status indicators and loading components
  - Create error handling utilities for authentication failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.2_

- [x] 7. Optimize performance and eliminate redundant API calls
  - Remove duplicate profile fetching from individual pages
  - Implement proper caching of authentication state
  - Optimize context re-renders to prevent unnecessary updates
  - Add performance monitoring for authentication operations
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 8. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Implement centralized error handling for authentication failures
  - Add user-friendly error messages for common authentication issues
  - Create fallback UI components for authentication errors
  - Add proper error boundaries around authentication-dependent components
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 4.2_

- [x] 9. Create unit tests for centralized authentication
  - Write tests for enhanced AuthProvider functionality
  - Test requireAuth() and requireRole() helper methods

- [x] 11. Fix authentication redirect loop in middleware
  - Resolve session validation issues between middleware and client-side auth
  - Fix cookie sharing between middleware Supabase client and AuthProvider client
  - Ensure middleware properly recognizes authenticated sessions
  - Test that authenticated users can access protected pages without redirect loops
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1_

- [x] 12. Fix post-login redirect flow and runtime errors
  - Change login redirect from dashboard to home page for better UX
  - Investigate and fix runtime error on home page after successful login
  - Ensure dashboard is accessible as a feature for results and tracking
