# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current college account creation flow has a fundamental issue: it requires users to select from existing colleges when creating a college account, but there's no clear path for new colleges to register themselves first. This creates a chicken-and-egg problem where new colleges cannot create accounts because they don't exist in the system yet.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a college representative from a new institution, I want to be able to create a college account even if my college is not yet registered in the system, so that I can establish my institution's presence on the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a college representative visits the college signup page THEN they SHALL see an option to either select an existing college or register a new college
2. WHEN a user selects "Register New College" THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the college registration flow
3. WHEN a user completes college registration THEN they SHALL be automatically redirected back to complete their personal account creation
4. WHEN a user creates an account for a newly registered college THEN they SHALL be automatically associated as the primary contact for that college

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a college representative from an existing institution, I want to be able to select my college from the list and create my account, so that I can manage my institution's profile and applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a college representative visits the college signup page THEN they SHALL see a searchable dropdown of existing colleges
2. WHEN a user selects an existing college THEN they SHALL be able to complete their account creation normally
3. WHEN multiple representatives from the same college create accounts THEN the system SHALL handle multiple contacts for the same institution
4. WHEN a user selects a college THEN the system SHALL validate that the college is active and accepting new representatives

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the college account creation flow to be intuitive and prevent confusion, so that new colleges can easily onboard without getting stuck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user cannot find their college in the dropdown THEN they SHALL see clear instructions on how to register a new college
2. WHEN a user is in the middle of the signup process THEN their progress SHALL be preserved if they need to register a new college
3. WHEN a college registration is completed THEN the user SHALL be seamlessly returned to complete their personal account
4. WHEN there are validation errors THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a college representative, I want the system to remember my college selection and personal information during the registration process, so that I don't have to re-enter information if I need to register my college first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts the college signup process THEN their form data SHALL be preserved in session storage
2. WHEN a user navigates to register a new college THEN their personal information SHALL be retained
3. WHEN a user completes college registration THEN they SHALL return to the signup form with their college pre-selected
4. WHEN a user completes the entire flow THEN all temporary data SHALL be cleared from storage
