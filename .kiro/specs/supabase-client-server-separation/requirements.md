# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application is experiencing build errors due to improper mixing of client-side and server-side Supabase client usage. The error occurs when server-side components that use `next/headers` are imported into client-side components, violating Next.js App Router constraints. This issue needs to be resolved to ensure proper separation of client and server-side database operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper separation between client-side and server-side Supabase operations, so that the application builds successfully without import conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client component needs database operations THEN it SHALL use only client-side Supabase functions
2. WHEN a server component needs database operations THEN it SHALL use only server-side Supabase functions  
3. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL NOT have any import conflicts between client and server components
4. IF a service needs to work in both contexts THEN it SHALL provide separate client and server implementations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want college profile services to work correctly in client components, so that the colleges page renders without build errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the colleges page loads THEN it SHALL successfully fetch college data using client-side operations
2. WHEN college profile services are called from client components THEN they SHALL use the client-side Supabase client
3. WHEN college profile services are called from server components THEN they SHALL use the server-side Supabase client
4. WHEN the enhanced college profile service methods are used THEN they SHALL detect the execution context and use the appropriate client

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear separation of database utility functions, so that I can use the appropriate functions in the correct context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN importing database utilities THEN there SHALL be clear client and server variants available
2. WHEN a client component imports database utilities THEN it SHALL only import client-side functions
3. WHEN a server component imports database utilities THEN it SHALL only import server-side functions
4. WHEN database utilities are refactored THEN existing functionality SHALL remain intact
