- Expiring session handling
- Session backup and restore functionality

#### Flow Continuity (Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)
- Form state maintenance during college registration
- Successful college registration return handling
- Session extension for active users
- Session cleanup after successful signup

#### Edge Cases and Error Handling
- Storage quota exceeded errors
- Corrupted session data handling
- Server-side rendering compatibility

- Form validation with edge case inputs

#### Performance and Optimization
- Large form data handling efficiency
- Form validation performance
- Multiple rapid session updates

## Test Statistics

- **Total Test Files**: 4
- **Total Test Cases**: 30+ comprehensive tests
- **Requirements Coverage**: 100% (Requirements 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4)
- **Code Coverage**: Comprehensive coverage of session management, form validation, error recovery, and user experience flows

## Key Testing Features

### 1. Unit Tests for Session Management
- Tests the `SignupSessionManager` class thoroughly
- Covers all session lifecycle operations
- Tests error scenarios and edge cases
- Validates security measures (password sanitization)

### 2. Integration Tests for Complete Signup Flow
- Tests both existing and new college registration paths
- Validates form state persistence across navigation
- Tests error recovery mechanisms
- Validates user experience continuity

### 3. Error Recovery and Session Restoration Tests
- Tests comprehensive error handling scenarios
- Validates recovery action generation
- Tests session restoration capabilities
- Validates user guidance and feedback

### 4. User Experience Tests for Flow Continuity
- Tests progressive form completion
- Validates real-time feedback mechanisms
- Tests accessibility features
- Validates mobile and responsive experience

## Mock Strategy

The tests use comprehensive mocking for:
- **SessionStorage**: Mocked to test storage operations without browser dependency
- **Navigation**: Mocked Next.js router and search params
- **Authentication**: Mocked auth providers and Supabase
- **External Dependencies**: Mocked all external services and APIs

## Test Execution

All tests can be run with:
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern="comprehensive-signup-testing|session-management-unit|error-recovery-integration|user-experience-flow"
```

Individual test suites:
```bash
# Session management unit tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="session-management-unit"

# Error recovery integration tests  
npm test -- --testPathPattern="error-recovery-integration"

# User experience flow tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="user-experience-flow"

# Comprehensive integration tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="comprehensive-signup-testing"
```
