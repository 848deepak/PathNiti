        question: "What stream should I choose after class 10?",
        answer: "The choice of stream depends on your interests, aptitude, and career goals. Science stream is good for engineering, medicine, and research careers. Commerce is ideal for business, finance, and management. Arts offers opportunities in humanities, social sciences, and creative fields. Consider taking our comprehensive assessment to get personalized recommendations."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I prepare for competitive exams?",
        answer: "Start early with a structured study plan. Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorization. Practice regularly with mock tests. Join coaching classes if needed. Stay updated with current affairs. Maintain a healthy study-life balance. Remember, consistency is key to success."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the career options in science stream?",
        answer: "Science stream offers diverse career paths including Engineering (Computer, Mechanical, Civil, etc.), Medicine (MBBS, BDS, Pharmacy), Pure Sciences (Physics, Chemistry, Biology), Research, Data Science, Biotechnology, and many more. Each field has specific requirements and opportunities."
      },
      {
        question: "How to choose the right college?",
        answer: "Consider factors like accreditation, faculty quality, placement records, infrastructure, location, fees, and programs offered. Check if the college is recognized by relevant authorities. Visit the campus if possible. Talk to current students and alumni. Our platform can help you find colleges based on your preferences."
      },
      {
        question: "What scholarships are available for students?",
        answer: "Various scholarships are available from government, private organizations, and colleges. These include merit-based, need-based, and category-specific scholarships. Some popular ones are National Scholarship Portal, state government scholarships, and college-specific scholarships. Check eligibility criteria and application deadlines."
      },
      {
        question: "How to manage stress during exams?",
        answer: "Maintain a regular study schedule with breaks. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing and meditation. Get adequate sleep and exercise regularly. Eat healthy food. Avoid last-minute cramming. Stay positive and believe in your preparation. Seek help from teachers or counselors if needed."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between government and private colleges?",
        answer: "Government colleges are funded by the state/central government, have lower fees, and often better infrastructure. Private colleges are funded privately, may have higher fees, but often offer more modern facilities and industry connections. Both can provide quality education depending on the specific institution."
      },
      {
        question: "How to improve my communication skills?",
        answer: "Practice speaking in front of a mirror or with friends. Read books, newspapers, and articles regularly. Join debate clubs or public speaking groups. Watch educational videos and listen to podcasts. Write daily to improve your writing skills. Don't be afraid to make mistakes - they help you learn."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the benefits of vocational courses?",
        answer: "Vocational courses provide practical skills for specific careers. They are shorter in duration, cost-effective, and have good job prospects. They focus on hands-on training and industry-relevant skills. Many vocational courses also offer direct entry into the workforce or further education opportunities."
      },
      {
        question: "How to balance studies and extracurricular activities?",
        answer: "Create a realistic schedule that includes both studies and activities. Prioritize your tasks based on importance and deadlines. Learn to say no to activities that don't align with your goals. Use time management techniques like the Pomodoro method. Remember that extracurricular activities can enhance your overall development."
